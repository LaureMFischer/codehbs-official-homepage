# CODE@HBS Official Homepage

This is the official website for CODE@HBS. Download or clone this repository to your desktop and submit a pull request for updates.

## How to Use
This website is built using a static webpage builder called Jekyll. We used the {Personal} template theme designed by PanosSakkos. See more on [Github](https://panossakkos.github.io/personal-jekyll-theme/).  

We'd your help to make this site even better. After cloning the repo, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem. In your command line enter the following commands

`gem install jekyll`

`gem install jekyll-paginate`

`gem install jemoji`

After cd'ing into the codehbs-official-homepage folder, you can start the Jekyll server by typing:

`jekyll serve`

Look for your local server address. Most likely your Jekyll page will be hosted at localhost:4000. 

## Git Workflow
Always make a feature branch before submitting a pull request. Good feature branches are use the following format:

`your-initials/feature-you-are-adding` 

For example: `arc/add-board-member-bios`
